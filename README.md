# Restaurant reviews-app-stage-1
- This is an web application for reviewing restaurants. It utilizes a service worker so that when the user visits the 
  page for the first time, content is cached for offline use.


### How to get started
1. First clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/BILLthebuilder/restaurant-reviews-stage-1.git` to your computer

2. In the project folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.

    * In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 9000` (or some other port, if port 9000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 9000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) for instructions on how to download.

3. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:9000`, and you are good to go.
